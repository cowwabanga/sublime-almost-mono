# Almost Mono Color Scheme for Sublime Text

This is port of [almost-mono-themes](https://github.com/cryon/almost-mono-themes) for Emacs, with some adjustments.

This color scheme has [minimal scope coverage](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/scope_naming.html#minimal-scope-coverage) of Sublime Text.

Tested on Sublime Text 4 (build 4126), but should be working with ST3 as well.

There are 4 color schemes inside:

- white
- black
- gray
- cream.
