Almost Mono Color Scheme for Sublime Text
=========================================

Four monochromatic color schemes (white, black, gray, cream) for Sublime Text 4.
Actually, this is a port of almost-mono-themes[1] for Emacs with personal adjustments.
At the moment very work-in-progress (has just minimal scope coverage[2]) and kind of abandoned.
